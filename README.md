# Halo-wail

## Description

**Halo-wail** is a rhythm game by me, **Exedice**. You're playing as a pumpkin who is stuck to the stump in the middle of the gamefield with a rope.

## Gameplay

You can only go around the stump to avoid the white beam attacks.
Press *\[Space]* or *\[Right-Click]* to change the direction you're going in.
Press *\[Enter]* to start/pause/resume the game.
Press *\[Q]* to exit the level.
Have fun!

## Technical side

• Made with Svelte and Typescript.
• To play: open the directory, install the dependencies, build the app with `npm run build`, ***serve*** the app in `public` directory.
